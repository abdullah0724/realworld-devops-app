# Full Stack Application Deployment With Docker

Welcome to my Full Stack Application Deployment With Docker project! üöÄ

This project demonstrates the power of Docker and Docker Compose in deploying a full stack application seamlessly on AWS EC2. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started with containerization, this project provides an excellent opportunity to dive into deploying complex applications with ease.

## Project Overview

Building and deploying full stack applications can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to managing dependencies, environments, and scaling. With Docker, I simplify this process by encapsulating each component of the application into containers, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

## Features

- **Client Service**: Frontend built with modern frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.
- **API Services**: Backend services handling various aspects of the application logic.
- **Database Service**: Utilizing MySQL or another database management system to store and manage application data.
- **Worker Service**: Managing background tasks efficiently.
- **Redis**: Leveraging Redis for caching and message brokering.
- **Nginx**: Serving as a high-performance web server and reverse proxy for routing requests to the appropriate services.

## Why Docker?

- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any platform, making deployment across different environments a breeze.
- **Isolation**: Each container encapsulates its dependencies, ensuring that applications run consistently regardless of the host environment.
- **Scalability**: Docker's lightweight nature enables effortless scaling of services horizontally or vertically as demand fluctuates.
- **DevOps Efficiency**: Docker streamlines the development-to-production workflow, empowering me to ship code faster and with fewer errors.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheToriqul/Full-Stack-Application-Deployment-with-Docker.git
cd Full-Stack-Application-Deployment-with-Docker
```

2. **Set Environment Variables** (if needed):

If any environment variables are required, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the variables there.

3. **Build and Run the Docker Containers**:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. **Access the Application**:

Once the containers are up and running, access the application in your web browser using the public IP address of your AWS EC2 instance. Replace `localhost` with the public IP address.
